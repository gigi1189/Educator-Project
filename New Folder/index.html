        <h3> Hi there! </h3>
        <p>
            Thank you for being here! This project was made to analyze the experience
            of LGBTQ+ youth from the perspective of an educator, in the context of outside research
            and studies.
        </br>
        </br>
            I interviewed Claire Jones, a k-8 art teacher in a tiny school in rural 
            West Virginia. I know her from attending her class for a couple of years 
            and staying in touch after graduation. She has since won educator of the year 
            in her county and been in the top 10 educators state-wide!
        </br>
        </br>
            Put something  here about if you have questions or concerns. 
            Also don't forget to put stuff about yourself Gigi!!
        </br>
        </br>
            Also remember to talk about the way the analysis will work. As well as the key 
            for the interview. My words are written in red, hers are in black, etc. :3   
        </p>
